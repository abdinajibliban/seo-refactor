# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor by Abdinajib Liban

## My Task

This week I was given an on-the-job ticket which meant that I was given starter code that I needed to modify. I was instructed to take existing code and refactor it. 

A marketing agency called Horiseon hired me to make their current site more accessible. 


## The User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```

## My Result

I refactored the code for Horiseon. The codebase now follows accessiblity standards. The site is optimized for search engines.
